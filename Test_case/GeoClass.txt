!  Sub-polar taiga needleleaf forest                       ; 2;  Forest and woodlands with trees generally taller than 3 meters and more than 5% of total vegetation cover with shrubs and lichens commonly present in the understory. The tree crown cover contains at least 75 percent of needleleaved species. This type occurs across Alaska and northern Canada and may consist of treed muskeg or wetlands. Forest canopies are variable and often sparse	 with generally greater tree cover in the southern latitude parts of the zone than the north.												
!  Tropical or sub-tropical broadleaf evergreen forest     ; 3;  Forests generally taller than 5 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover. These occur in the southern United States and Mexico. These forests have greater than 75 percent of tree crown cover represented by evergreen species.													
! Tropical or sub-tropical broadleaf deciduous forest     ; 4;  Forests generally taller than 5 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover.  These occur in the southern United States and Mexico. These forests have greater than 75 percent of tree crown cover represented by deciduous species. 													
!  Temperate or sub-polar broadleaf deciduous forest       ; 5;  Forests generally taller than 3 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover.  These occur in the northern United States	 Canada and mountainous zones of Mexico. These forests have greater than 75 percent of tree crown cover represented by deciduous species.												
!  Mixed forest                                            ; 6;  Forests generally taller than 3 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover.  Neither needleleaf nor broadleaf tree species occupy more than 75 percent of total tree cover	 but are co-dominant.												
!  Tropical or sub-tropical shrubland                      ; 7;  Areas dominated by woody perennial plants with persistent woody stems less than 5 meters tall and typically greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class occurs across the southern United States and Mexico. 													
!  Temperate or sub-polar shrubland                        ; 8;  Areas dominated by woody perennial plants with persistent woody stems less than 3 meters tall and typically greater than 20% of total vegetation.  This class occurs across the northern United States	 Canada and highlands of Mexico. 												
!  Tropical or sub-tropical grassland                      ; 9;  Areas dominated by graminoid or herbaceous vegetation generally accounting for greater than 80% of total vegetation cover.  These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling	 but can be utilized for grazing.  This class occurs across the southern United States and Mexico. 												
!  Temperate or sub-polar grassland                        ; 10; Areas dominated by graminoid or herbaceous vegetation	 generally accounting for greater than 80% of total vegetation cover.  These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling	 but can be utilized for grazing.  This class occurs across Canada	 United States and highlands of Mexico.										
!  Sub-polar or polar shrubland-lichen-moss                ; 11; Areas dominated by dwarf shrubs with lichen and moss typically accounting for at least 20% of total vegetation cover. This class occurs across northern Canada and Alaska.													
!  Sub-polar or polar grassland-lichen-moss                ; 12; Areas dominated by grassland with lichen and moss typically accounting for at least 20% of total vegetation cover. This class occurs across northern Canada and Alaska. 													
!  Sub-polar or polar barren-lichen-moss                   ; 13; Areas dominated by a mixture of bare areas with lichen and moss that typically account for at least 20% of total vegetation cover. This class occurs across northern Canada and Alaska.													
!  Wetland                                                 ; 14; Areas dominated by perennial herbaceous and woody wetland vegetation which is influenced by the water table at or near surface over extensive periods of time.  This includes marshes	 swamps	 bogs	 mangroves etc either coastal or inland where water is present for a substantial period annually.										
!  Cropland                                                ; 15; Areas dominated by intensively managed crops. These areas typically require human activities for their maintenance. This includes areas used for the production of annual crops	 such as corn	 soybeans	 wheat	 maize	 vegetables	 tobacco	 cotton etc and also perennial grasses for grazing and woody crops such as orchards and vineyards. Crop vegetation accounts for greater than 20 percent of total vegetation.  This class does not represent natural grasslands used for light to moderate grazing.						
!  Barren lands                                            ; 16; Areas characterized by bare rock	 gravel	 sand	 silt	 clay	 or other earthen material	" with little or no ""green"" vegetation present regardless of its inherent ability to support life. Generally"	 vegetation accounts for less than 10% of total cover.						
!  Urban                                                   ; 17; Areas that contain at least 30 percent or greater urban constructed materials for human activities (cities	 towns	 transportation etc.)											
!  Water                                                   ; 18; Areas of open water	 generally with less than 25% cover of non-water cover types.  This class refers to areas that are consistently covered by water.												
!  Snow and Ice                                            ; 19; Areas characterized by a perennial cover of ice and/or snow	 generally greater than 25% of total cover.
